In The Grey is a game made by House Hippo Games and is a story driven puzzle game that was made for academic purposes. The goal of this project was to experience the entire process of building a game suitable for release.

My major roles on this project were AI programmer, UI programmer, Animation/Camera programmer and Tools programmer as well as many smaller miscellaneous tasks.

Some major features I built for this game include:

[Cutscene system](https://github.com/zacyzacy/Cinematic-Camera-Controller-Unity) that allows you to ‘stage’ events by placing characters in specific locations/positions and leveraging the Unity animation system in order to easily make very smooth camera pans or instant cuts.

Main NPC AI that guides the player through the game all while having his own agenda. Key features include steering behaviors, behavior trees, node based traversal, and other AI patterns.

[Unity editor extension](https://gist.github.com/zacyzacy/aa9746cb7fe2a78935f7c9182dd37b8b) for creating the in game menu which is presented as a book. Features include automatically find the right sound and animations to play as well as managing the collectibles that are found throughout the game.
