This project is a proof of concept made for the Game Dev League September 2016 GamJam.
The theme of the GameJam was AI.
The crowd can handle many units (tested up to 1000 with no performance hit) that spawn as either an assassin, target or regular NPC.
Assassins will get behind targets while the targets try to rally NPCs to crowd around it.
Regular NPCs will wander around randomly.
