In The Grey is a game made by House Hippo Games and is a story driven puzzle game that was made for academic purposes. The goal of this project was to experience the entire process of building a game suitable for release.

My major roles on this project were AI programmer, UI programmer, Animation/Camera programmer and Tools programmer as well as many smaller miscellaneous tasks.

Some major features I built for this game include:

[Cutscene system](https://github.com/zacyzacy/Cinematic-Camera-Controller-Unity) that allows you to ‘stage’ events by placing characters in specific locations/positions and leveraging the Unity animation system in order to easily make very smooth camera pans or instant cuts.

[Main NPC AI](https://github.com/zacyzacy/Unity-Steering-Behavior) that guides the player through the game all while having his own agenda. Key features include steering behaviors, behavior trees, node based traversal, and other AI patterns.

[Unity editor extension](https://gist.github.com/zacyzacy/aa9746cb7fe2a78935f7c9182dd37b8b) for creating the in game menu which is presented as a book. Features include automatically find the right sound and animations to play as well as managing the collectibles that are found throughout the game.
